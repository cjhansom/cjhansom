 hello friend my name is innocent i am learning how to program and it has being a very nice expirience, let
me tell you more about it.
frist we were thought about what computer really is and it apears we use computers litrally every day. and some computers are 
are machanical while others are not but they all carryout a particular purpose  which involves accepting data processing it
and giving back the result as output or information. lets talk about one of this machanical type of computer the CURTA.

 WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE;
the curta is a mechanical machine invented in 1930s by  Curt Herzstark.
 To me it looks like a small win drum with a liver because it has the same shape like one,(or perhaps a paper grander)  just 
that it has a kind of stire rod at the top that when turned tourchs the inner chambers of the numbers that appears at the top
of it thereby causing it to change.it has no batries, numbers ranging from zero to nine is found at the top. and something like a 
pin is also found at the top. and at the round up to botom of it are also numbers and botton like objects that moves up and down.

 THE KIND OF DATA IT ACCEPTS;
The CURTA is a calculating machine that deals with add of numbers, multipling of numbers and subtracting of numbers. put simply its 
a calculator.

 HOW IT WORKS;
the stire liver run down at the middle of the cylinder and it also has teeth that is connected to the result chamber. so if any of this
teeth is affected it simply turns round thereby changing the possition of the chamber and affecting the result and thats why we move 
the side botton to affect the disired number which then affects our result. 

 MULTIPLCATION
The CURTA makes it easy to calculate numbers in a very facinating way, and infact easy way. let take for instance we want to matiply 
four-hundred by three we simply move the fouth botton at the side of it down to four while the rest are at zero and then turn the 
stire botton at the top clock wise three times and there you go the result appears at the top of it.

 STRATION
Straction is also very easy we just lift up the liver we used to stire a bit and the red line apears at the liver then we turn again 
and it simply subtracts we could also turn the top head to the numbers one which means maltiply by ten, when its at two it means multiply
by two tens and so on.
